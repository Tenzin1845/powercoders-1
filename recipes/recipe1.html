            BEAT eggs, water, salt and pepper in small bowl until blended.

            HEAT butter in 6 to 8-inch nonstick omelet pan or skillet over
            medium-high heat until hot. TILT pan to coat bottom. POUR IN egg
            mixture. Mixture should set immediately at edges.
        </li>
        <li>GENTLY PUSH cooked portions from edges toward the center with
              inverted turner so that uncooked eggs can reach the hot pan surface.
              CONTINUE cooking, tilting pan and gently moving cooked portions as
              needed.
        </li>
        <li>When top surface of eggs is thickened and no visible liquid egg remains,
               PLACE filling on one side of the omelet. FOLD omelet in half with turner.
                With a quick flip of the wrist, turn pan and INVERT or SLIDE omelet
                 onto plate. SERVE immediately.
